## Goal
This analysis was performed as part of a group project in the MIDS program. Teams of three were given a messy dataset containing information about crime rate, demographics, and other factors by county. Our goal was to create a policy that will reduce crime rate. 

## Conclusion
My team and I came to the conclusion that the best deterrent for crime isn't harsh sentences or more police; the best deterrent is the perception that if you commit a crime, you will be caught. This jupyter notebook contains details about how we arrived at this conclusion.
