## Machine Learning Projects (in Python)

[Mountain Project Sentiment Analysis using Transfer Learning and DistilBERT ](/Machine_Learning/mp/mountain_project.md)

This end-to-end project uses deep learning for sentimant analysis of natural language. The goal is to label the sentiment of Mountain Project forums to determine what gear climbers think to be the best. The writeup follows the process from webscraping, to data cleaning, to model selection, and final analysis.

[Audio Super-Resolution - Current Project](/Machine_Learning/DeciBull/summary.md)

This is an ongoing project that uses GANs to upsample low quality audio in real time.

[Car Damage Detection Part 1 (Image Classification)](/Machine_Learning/car_damage/sup_summary.md)

This section uses traditional machine learning (KNN, Naive Bayes) and CNNs (with and without dropout) to classify images of cars as damaged or whole. 

[Car Damage Detection Part 2 (Identify damage location)](/Machine_Learning/car_damage/unsupervised_learning/writeup/unsup_summary.md)

This section uses Mask R-CNN to identify the location of the damage on the car.

## Projects Using R

[Experiment (A/B Analysis): Are Difficulty Labels helpful for Test Takers?](R/survey/deng_degner_heck_final.md)

This end-to-end projects follows the process of designing an experiment, running it on real participants, gathering and cleaning data, and analyzing results. The study provides evidence that difficulty labels do significantly increase student scores on exams.

[Crime Rate Analysis](/R/Crime_Rate_group_lab/Crime_Rate_group_lab.md)

This project seeks to determine a method to reduce crime in an area. In the end, my team concluded that the best way to deter crime is to increase the perception that cirminals will get caught.

[Umpire Lifespan Analysis](/R/Umpire_Lifespan/Umpire_Lifespan.md)

Given information about an umpire, can we predict if they are still alive?

[Lasso and bootstrap exploration](/R/Lasso_Example/Model_Selection_boot_lasso.md)

This document walks through two examples demonstrating the use of LASSO regression and bootstrapping for model selection.
