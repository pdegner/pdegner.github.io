## Goal

The goal of this project is to to predict the location and severity of damage to a car given a provided image of the damaged car. This information could be used for faster insurance assessment and claims processing.

## Data

Training and validation data was made available through Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/anujms/car-damage-detection#0001.JPEG

## Results

Through supervised learning we were able to classify cars as damaged or not damaged. Through unsupervised learning we were able to mask the damage on the cars.
