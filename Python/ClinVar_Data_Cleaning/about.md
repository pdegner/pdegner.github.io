# Data Cleaning
The file that I cleaned is too big to upload to GitHub, but can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing


# Prompt

This was part of my final exam for my Python course.

Your boss comes to you Monday morning and says “I figured out our next step; we are going to pivot from an online craft store and become a data center for genetic disease information! I found ClinVar which is a repository that contains expert curated data, and it is free for the taking. This is a gold mine! Look at the file and tell me what gene and mutation combinations are classified as dangerous.”

Make sure that you only give your boss the dangerous mutations and include:

1) Gene name

2) Mutation ID number

3) Mutation Position (chromosome & position)

4) Mutation value (reference & alternate bases)

5) Clinical severity

6) Disease that is implicated

    Limit your output to the first 100 harmful mutations and tell your boss how many total harmful mutations were found in the file

    Use a modified "clinvar_final.txt" at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing
