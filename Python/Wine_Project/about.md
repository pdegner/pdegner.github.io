# Wine Value
The goal of this project is to see what factors affect the price of wine. 
All of the files can be viewed here: https://github.com/pdegner/pdegner.github.io/tree/master/Python/Wine_Project 
My team took data from a Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
 * Unfortunately, this dataset is too big to upload to GitHub. If you download the file from the site above, we used the file called winemag-data-130k-v2.csv.
I scraped data from Wikipedia to get a list of wine notes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_tasting_descriptors

We then split the project into three parts:

Our economist, Andrew Divley, ran some initial statistical anlysis for our team. He also created the "wine_values" dataset for Ashley and I to use. 

Our GIS Data Scientist, Ashley Moss, used the geographical data in our dataset to create maps that indicate price, score, value, and other metrics by country. 

Finally, as our NLP Data Scientist, I used the scraped list of wine notes to analyze the descriptions of the wines. I wanted to know which descriptors, if any, lead to a higher price or higher value of wine. 

About the files:
 * Wine_Cleaning.ipynb is the notebook containing the code that createes my contribution to this project. 
    Unfortunately, I lost the code that scrapes the data from Wikipedia. 
 * Analysis_Slideshow.pdf is a pdf of our final presentation. 
 * Final_Report.pdf is a detailed report of all of our findings. 
 * Project_Proposal.pdf is our initial proposal. 
 * Wine_Notes.csv, and Wine_Value.csv are the datsets we used.
